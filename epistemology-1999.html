  <li>Experimented, and created.</li>
  <li>Know this, you know who robs you of sight.</li>
  <li>Meaningless, said the Preacher. Meaningless.</li>
</ol>

<p>There once was an older girl, a younger woman, who saved me.</p>

<p>On her advice, I quit my job. I gave my notice at summer’s end, and Alain set me free from Génoise et Thé. &lt; You can’t be kept, mon gars. &gt; He patted my shoulder, and we shook hands, a parting between men. Waiting outside, Selene took off her sunglasses and dabbed her eyes.</p>

<p>I cleaned my room, fussing over details she fixed sooner and better. The curator was a lovely guest, bringing gifts and Charlotte. We were in bright humor from the change in the season, the shift in the wind. I did well as a host, as a man. I shaved my face, brushed my teeth, wore my shirt, and owned my life.</p>

<p>At the Old Port, we sat on a bench. She spoke, and I learned. I asked, she asked further. We leaned into mystery, and tackled the snake, fang and venom, as it was.</p>

<p>The questions multiplied, as she said they would. Questions — at the café, a glum spot for me as a customer; at ritzy establishments around the city, places where she sought secrets and traded la bise with socialites, a trace of summer fever in her fashion; in the metro, on the last train of the night; in the calm of our chaste slumber, as I lay awake with her dreaming at my side, mouth open but a sliver.</p>

<p>So terrifying were her answers, I should never fall to sleep with a drop of her insight. I was glad, so glad, to not sleep. It was the longest September, the best of my life. I soon forgot my sunrise oath, the promise made in early July.</p>

<p>A day before she left, marking a sudden end, was the one and only time she stood us up. Charlotte and I mused about Epistemology over Alain’s coffee, and parted on the hour.</p>

<p>Later, the curator came in without knocking. Her tone commanded: &lt; The place around the corner. My tab. &gt;</p>

<p>She dressed the same, yet seemed not herself. I stood, and warned her to look away. I changed, and her sad eyes looked not away. Ah — they were a new color.</p>

<p>At Bar des Pins, sipping a gin and tonic, I regarded her, mentor and patron. She called the waiter in French, and touched my arm. An accident? Her hand stayed. &lt; Do you ever feel like life is so short, you might miss it? So short, I never knew it was over. &gt; She noticed her slip, and drank from the glass bottle I pushed to her. Selene was a stranger from a distant land, unraveling traveler in our midst, her blouse revealing what the heart was ashamed to know.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat, and tried — failed — to pull away. &lt; You’re acting off. &gt;</p>

<p>&lt; Right? &gt; A drop of Perrier ran down her chin. She wiped, hiccuped, sniffed. &lt; I am awake. Life is but a dream. &gt;</p>

<p>I paid with her card, and the tall wanderer leaned on my shoulder. We hobbled to my un et demi, tidy as I left it. She twirled, and kicked off her Converse sneakers.</p>

<p>&lt; Home, Gale Jones. Let us be merry. &gt; A cackle bubbled, escaping her beautiful wide mouth. &lt; The night is young. &gt;</p>

<p>I held her, inches from an edge. &lt; Let’s calm down. Come, sit. &gt;</p>

<p>Her embrace threw me off balance. On my bed, collapsed and tangled with me, her whisper betrayed: &lt; Thanks. But no thanks. &gt;</p>

<p>She was on top, captivating me with frost and fire. She held her ponytail in disdain, narrowing her eyes.</p>

<p>&lt; It all crashes down. &gt;</p>

<p>A tug and a flick — like that, her hair tumbled. Bleached strands framed the milk-rose mask, the royal portrait leaning in. I stared at dark roots, short lashes, perfect teeth.</p>

<p>&lt; My word to your word; my heart to your heart; my lips… &gt;</p>

<p>A shy kiss, a brush.</p>

<p>&lt; J’ai baisé ta bouche. &gt; She hummed, and let a drop fall. &lt; So it is bitter, the taste of love. &gt;</p>

<p>Is that how it was always meant to be? So halting, soft, and burning? Was that the perfect first I could not keep, the one I see anew in every dream? I looked away. &lt; We should stop. &gt;</p>

<p>&lt; Should we? &gt; She sounded sure, yet her legs quivered as I thought of Bambi, of fawn and doe, of Louise.</p>

<p>I was aroused, and awake. &lt; I want to stop. &gt;</p>

<p>&lt; Please. &gt; Her lips, seductive and mature. Her eyes — when were they ever so young? Those dark gems, free of color contacts, more than the false blue jewels I knew, revealed a maiden pure and innocent.</p>

<p>&lt; Selene. &gt; I pleaded, and knew not for what. But then, she threw up, cupped her mouth, and wept.</p>

<p>&lt; Meaningless, said the Preacher. Meaningless. &gt;</p>
