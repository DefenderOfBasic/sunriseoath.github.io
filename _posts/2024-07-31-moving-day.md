# Moving Day | A Fresh Start

My wife and I are moving today. As I write this, the last load of laundry is waiting to be moved over to the dryer. I am waiting for the piano movers. 
The love of my dreams is working her last day at a music summer camp. This afternoon, I will drive us an hour and a half to our new life back in my hometown.

What a fitting day for me to also start this new GitHub Pages site. I had one in high school that I hard-coded in HTML (barely any CSS!), and as one can imagine this became a nightmare to edit and maintain.
This time, I will keep things simple and stick to editing through my browser unless I want to do something way fancier than just write blog posts.

The piano movers came and went. Our Yamaha U2 is now in the truck.

Many of these writings will be streams of consciousness, often copied out of my Obsidian. I never said I was going to be trying very hard.
