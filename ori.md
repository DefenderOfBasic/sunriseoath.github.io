# Open Research Institute (ORI)

As of the time of writing on March 11, 2025, I am a founding member and independent researcher at the [Open Research Institute](https://open-research-institute.github.io/), a new project and movement “for all who pursue understanding reality — a space where prediction trumps paradigm”. I am excited for the initiatives we have lined up, which includes the creation of a central documentation that indexes the writings of all researchers.

I plan to use this as an opportunity to move more of my writings online and organize it into longform archives. As this is a chance to collaborate with other writers and thinkers in a public-facing context, I will also use this chance to begin the project of writing proper indexes of my own work as I understand it. This is something that I have put off for a long time in my own writing: I am more willing to rewrite the same things again and again rather than perform a serious literature review and yank everything together! Mostly, I am afraid of hard work. But why work hard, when I can hardly work?

I will be using my Fandom Wiki page ([Sᴜɴʀɪsᴇ Oᴀᴛʜ](https://open-research-institute.fandom.com/wiki/Sunrise_Oath)) as a temporary landing page for my own content, one which is naturally connected to the different materials with which others are tinkering. This will not necessarily be my de facto homepage forever, but for now it is a good starting point. We can consider this blog post itself to be but one more rhizome within a network of documents. We should fully expect that as better options come along, we will progressively take them.

I outlined three research interests on the Fandom Wiki page: Christian systems thinking, liberal fundamentalism, and experimental theology. There are many other things I can write about, but outlining three different points already gives some dimensionality to the constructs that people might have of my work, and in turn of the image that I have among peers when it is time to think together about problems.

I plan on using this blog and the Fandom Wiki page as twin pillars of a very informal nucleus for my work in the next while. There shall be much linking back and forth, many ninja edits, much fiddling with things that likely do not matter in the long term. For now, I will link to some X (formerly Twitter) threads that come to mind when I think about my research topics.

At times like these, I am glad for how public school taught me to write “formal” (according to form) essays, esp. in the triple three-point argument format. Nine ideas supporting three arguments for one conclusion happens to give a lot of room for exploration, and is much easier than the mission of writing *On Everything* that has plagued me since I was young.

I am also glad that I have lost the part of me that cringes when I call my Twitter rambling “research”. That is exactly what it is, and I am proud of it. It is just a matter of making informal writings on serious research into something more formal. To use a musical composition, this is similar to writing many album leaves, then collating them into character pieces, then organizing them into a piano cycle.

Speaking of piano, I have a Liszt number of 5! Five tutelage steps away from Hungarian virtuoso pianist Franz Liszt. Read about it [here](https://minzart.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/i-have-a-liszt-number-of-5/), on my old WordPress blog. (I debated whether or not to link this, but I shall do this for the sake of completeness.)

I expect to write many updates in the future! Stay tuned, if you are so inclined. Great things are coming soon. Ish.
