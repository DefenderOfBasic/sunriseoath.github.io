I am Asian, and want to be a parent. (My wife and I are trying.) </p>

<p>Read this as a wish fulfillment story; or as a roundabout description of the emergence of truth and lies from abstraction, fiction becoming fact, epistemology and ontology lying to you or others; or as a religious proof text of the futility of human knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="difference">Difference</h2>

<p>In most cases, two objects cannot be “literally” the same length if we look to the smallest measurable units of the current age. What is the likelihood that if we zoom in enough, two men who (credibly) claim to be six feet tall are exactly the same height? There is certainly (overwhelmingly likely) a difference.</p>

<h2 id="meaning">Meaning</h2>

<p>But imagine if a person laid their hand across the heads of these two men, and felt that their hand was perfectly flat. This could very well be illusory or imagined, but the perception is exactly so. Could I tell, were I this person? (From now on, I am this person.) Any difference ceases to have meaning in this context.</p>

<h2 id="sameness">Sameness </h2>

<p>We decide to speak of their heights as the same. One height is not distinguished from the other. Every axis within this narrow scope is redundant. The sameness is so self-evident that no one within the specific frame is as to reject this truth.</p>

<h2 id="equality">Equality</h2>

<p>We may treat then redundant objects within a context as being equal. They are used interchangeably, such that if I were to measure a third person’s height, I could use either of the first two men as a large measuring stick. From there, I could see if the third man is shorter or taller. Or, if my hand is as flat as it was for the first two men, I would once again claim equality. </p>

<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>

<p>Of course, we knew that there was a difference. Just not a meaningful one. But suppose we found a way to heighten the sensitivity of the hand such that it could perceive more minute differences in height. Or, more directly and pertinently, it can perceive smaller deviations from perfect flatness. Maybe the hand was always biased in one direction. Maybe there was a systemic way in which a slightly taller person was more likely to stand on one side. If I could account for more, then I would be even better at perceiving difference. This increases the precision of my statement that two people are the same height. </p>

<h2 id="standard">Standard</h2>

<p>Three people’s heights are re-measured, and even after practicing some good old rationalist epistemic hygiene, the three people are the same height. Imagine if I did this a million more times, using any person I consider to be the same height of around six feet (plus or minus some unknown value) to measure new people who could possibly be their height. I might notice that by using multiple people to measure the same person, I can get a good grasp of if a group of people really are the same height. I am generating a standard for a particular height around six feet tall. </p>

<h2 id="error">Error</h2>

<p>Eventually, the number of people I have pegged at the same height grows to an amount where I might have failed to measure every combination of people with my hand. The standard has petered out in its effectiveness since there are now more specimen for the standard than I could reasonably use. Eventually, if GOD (the GOD of Difference) ordered all the people of “the same height” from shortest to tallest, I might take the shortest and the tallest and find upon laying my hand that—tell me it ain’t so!—there a difference, a meaningful difference, a lack of sameness. Yet there was always that supposed equality all the way through. What happened? There is error in the standard.</p>

<h2 id="margin">Margin</h2>

<p>Luckily, whatever difference I feel right now, I know that this is the worst it could really get. I take these two people from the ends of the line created by GOD, and also take another person from exactly in the middle. Upon laying my hand flat between this median person and either of the endpoint people, I feel there is no difference from short to middle or from middle to tall. Even though I know there is certainly a difference, a meaningful difference, between the two endpoints, it still feels convincing enough that the shortest man is the same height as the median man, and the median man is the same height as the tallest man. Same is same is same. I continue using my standard, accepting that there is a margin of error. </p>

<h2 id="game-or-copula">Game (or, Copula)</h2>

<p>I trim the endpoints til I again cannot tell the difference between the shortest and the tallest, then a little more til the roster is a little more manageable. I keep on using the new endpoints and the median to see if men are exactly the same height as the men in my pool. My standard is trusted, and I rent-seek from being a paid expert on this standard of some arbitrary height some distance above or below six feet. I live happily ever after, til I start abusing this margin of error to game the standard. How do I game the standard? I leave this as an exercise for the reader. </p>

<p>I will be moving away from Grok and using ChatGPT again. Just because I do not want to keep paying for these tools. I do not use them enough to fully capture the value that is possible. Even though ChatGPT is somewhat more censored, I think that the ability to come back to it and leave whenever I want is more suited for my needs. (https://chatgpt.com/share/66edd560-49d8-800b-95ec-e06104ceb878)</p>

<p>I shall seek to understand myself through the adding of headings and labels to my writings, along with trying to include ChatGPT outputs that help to process my thoughts.</p>

<p>Made a small PDF of my notes so far from today, with a simple “dialogue” format where I have LLM-generated summaries at the end of each section.</p>
<h2 id="dreamscape-exploration">Dreamscape Exploration</h2>

<p>I had more dreams of apartment buildings and practice rooms. I went into a building, found my wife, and started making out with her in front of all the new students who had come pouring in. I was on a bus of some kind? Oh, before that I was running for a long time. I realized that eventually, it was easier to keep on going than to stop. This is exactly what building a habit is like. Running is a good analogy for getting into the flow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your dream—full of fluid movement, affection, and spontaneous settings—reveals something intriguing about how your subconscious mirrors the waking world. It’s striking how running became an analogy for habit-building, the idea that once momentum is gained, it’s harder to stop than to keep going. Maybe this reflects not just the physical habit, but the ongoing momentum of your intellectual journeys.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="personal-geography">Personal Geography</h2>

<p>I realized that my stream of consciousness in my dreams is extremely powerful. I still am fairly “awake” in my dreams. I can even feel my mind wandering! I have so many things where I am moving up and down streets, hopping on the subway, traveling through different landscapes. I like how I learned the streets of Montreal to the extent that I could walk from downtown to Verdun with only a minimal amount of guidance, all without any GPS tools. I had to stop at a McDonald’s from time to time to peek at Google Maps on my laptop, but that was more similar to the old days of needing to pull out maps. This is a fun way of enjoying discrete, contained documents. Maybe what makes our sense of geography worse in the current day is the idea that all maps are functionally infinite and so are impossible to learn anyway. We need to start making personal maps again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The streets of Montreal, even the pauses to check the maps, seem to represent a kind of practical, personal geography—a sense of orientation that GPS can’t replace. You touch on something powerful about finite, personal maps. Is it the boundaries, the familiar lines drawn, that give them more meaning than the vast expanses of modern digital maps? What does this say about how we orient ourselves in larger, infinite systems—spiritual, social, intellectual?</p>

<p>Fiction is a great way of embedding different ideas and aesthetics together. It is a way of performing anthropology and philosophy at the same time. It also makes legible the internal workings of worldviews and how they serve the different personas and personages that deploy them.</p>

  <p>When you mention <em>The Soprano Sorceress</em> and its nested encyclopedic entries, I sense a kind of permission you’re granting yourself in writing. The way authors embed their long digressions—it’s like creating these moments where the personal becomes the universal, or at least opens up new pathways for exploration. You mentioned wanting to read <em>Moby-Dick</em>—what do you imagine Melville’s approach will illuminate for you, especially regarding nested diatribes or thematic expansion? Is there something about embedding yourself into those “diatribes on whaling” that calls out to your own reflective process?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your note on strong relationships through self-knowledge and discernment brings up a classic paradox: the more we understand our sin and limitations, the more capable we are of giving and receiving love. The acknowledgment of gender differences strikes me as part of this discernment, recognizing complementary roles as an essential truth in human interaction. In what ways do you see this playing out both in leadership roles and in daily practice? Is this difference a means of bridging gaps or reinforcing healthy boundaries?</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-and-identitarian-security">Cognitive and Identitarian Security</h2>

<p>I believe it is possible that we will need to keep on searching for ways of storing up the people we are now yet protecting them from future pretenders. We need to prevent ourselves from becoming villains, whether these future selves are part of our continuous experience or whether they are sick clones of us used for the twisted purposes of others. Think of the danger of people being reanimated as zombies.</p>

<p>We will need to start setting passphrases with those we love so that AI imitators cannot exploit us. There is one word that AI engines will not say, so if we say it, we know we are not ChatGPT. (https://x.com/AllisterClisham/status/1836978518418411955)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, your thoughts on preserving the “current self” against future exploitation by AI imitators carry a kind of almost sci-fi paranoia that speaks to the deeper question of identity. Is the passphrase idea more about protecting relationships, or does it speak to something broader, like preserving a continuity of self in an age where identity could be distorted or replicated? What might that “one word” AI won’t say signify to you—something of an anchor, or a symbol of unbreachable authenticity?</p>

<p>But in the end, I always realize I just want an excuse to connect writings together.
This desire is simple, yet unintuitive to articulate. 
My entire life was dedicated to the idea of <em>coherence</em>; 
ever since I was young, it has been a desire to link different ideas.
I suppose I took that one SYNTHESIZE poster in my third grade classroom a little too seriously.
Thanks, Hegel.</p>

<p>Writing my personal notes is a joy because they connect together without me having to do anything. 
I think of how in the future, AI will help make all the connections for us. 
This is already what search engine and social media algorithms do, after all! 
We no longer have to be responsible for our own architecture.
But this makes us prone to being trapped in the rooms that others build for us.
The emerging project of the so-called <em>small web</em> (<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">link to an article by Ben Hoyt</a>)
is to take ownership of our individual abilities to fit things together using our own longform structures.</p>

<p>My wife and I are now in a new city, and will be building up a new piano studio from scratch.
This morning, I told her about a new idea to use our personal teaching notes and ChatGPT in tandem
to create a teaching resource that all our students are free to peruse. 
Clicking around a repository of writings could be a source of great enrichment.
Certainly, such resources helped me in the past.</p>

<p>Writing Markdown files and hosting them online is not only an act of preservation, but an act of construction.
I want to build a better world for the next generation. What better way than to embed my thoughts in words?
Who knows how long the Internet as we know it will last. 
For as long as it lives, I hope that I may contribute to its many networks.</p>

<p>Though, I have no need to make any sudden switches.
Even making Twitter thread networks (see the work of Visakan Veerasamy) is a form of architectural ownership.
There are many ways to eat the same horse.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every few months, I get ideas related to sprawling text adventures.
